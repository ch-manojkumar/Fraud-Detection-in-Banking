# Fraud-Detection-in-Banking
Introduction:

With the increasing shift towards digital banking, the threat of financial fraud has also grown significantly. Traditional fraud detection methods, based on static rules, are often unable to detect new and sophisticated fraud patterns. This project focuses on developing an AI-powered fraud detection system using Machine Learning techniques in Python. The aim is to analyze large volumes of banking transaction data, identify suspicious patterns, and flag potentially fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

Objectives:

The main objectives of this project are:

-> To build a machine learning-based system for detecting fraudulent banking transactions.

-> To handle data imbalance between genuine and fraudulent records.

-> To select the best-performing model through comparative analysis.

-> To ensure high precision and recall in fraud detection.

-> To enable real-time deployment for use in banking systems.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Data for the project was obtained from publicly available datasets such as those on Kaggle (e.g., credit card fraud datasets) and through synthetic data generation using Python libraries like Faker and SDV. The dataset included both numerical and categorical features like transaction amount, time, location, and customer ID.
Preprocessing steps included:
Handling missing and duplicate values.
Encoding categorical variables using label and one-hot encoding.
Normalizing numerical fields for consistent model input.
Feature engineering to derive new attributes from existing ones (e.g., frequency of transactions per customer).

Model Development and Training:

Three machine learning models were selected for development and comparison:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): This instance-based model was used to classify transactions based on similarity to known cases. Distance-based calculations made it suitable for identifying outliers, but it was computationally expensive on larger datasets.

Random Forest: A powerful ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees. It was used due to its robustness against overfitting and its ability to rank feature importance, making it highly interpretable and effective for fraud detection.

XGBoost: This gradient boosting technique was chosen for its superior performance in structured datasets. It provided high accuracy and speed, and was particularly effective in handling imbalanced datasets when combined with custom objective functions or class weighting.

All models were trained using a stratified training set to ensure balanced representation. Hyperparameters were tuned using Grid Search and Cross-Validation to improve detection accuracy.

Model Evaluation and Deployment:

Evaluation was carried out using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

AUC-ROC Curve

Since detecting fraud with minimal false positives is critical, more emphasis was placed on precision and recall. Among the models, XGBoost delivered the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, followed by Random Forest, with KNN showing acceptable performance but higher computational cost.
For deployment, the chosen model was integrated into a Flask API and designed to work with real-time transaction systems. The system can flag and log suspicious transactions and generate alerts for further investigation.

Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates how AI and ML can be used to combat banking fraud efficiently. By analyzing historical transaction patterns, the developed system can flag potential frauds with high accuracy. Through proper preprocessing, model selection, and deployment planning, a practical and scalable fraud detection system was built. It lays the foundation for future improvements such as real-time learning, enhanced feature engineering, and integration with live banking data streams.
